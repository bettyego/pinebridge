      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Our origin story, in many ways, begins with our name. 'PineBridge' was chosen to reflect the firm's roots, 
        which developed as the former asset management division of AIG, headquartered on 'Pine' Street in New York's 
        financial district, and its aspirations for the future: 'Bridge' was the name of the project to transition 
        AIG's money management business into an independent entity.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Employees embraced the name and the idea it conveyed of a bridge to the future with roots in the past. 
        Independent since 2010, the firm continues to draw from its decades of investment experience across asset 
        classes, a network of global offices with talented and highly rated investment teams, and a world-class 
        infrastructure.
